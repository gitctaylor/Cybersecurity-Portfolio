# HTB Labs  

Welcome to my HTB write ups. This section is specfically designed to have documents written up with my experience and details how I completed these machines or labs.  

# Navigating  
This is layouted out so that navigation should be easy but if you get stuck, this is a quick navigation guide.  

This folder has two main folders Main and Starting-Point. This are the sections that can found on the HTB Labs website. Main is a folder that contains all machines that I have completed ordered by difficulty of the machines. Strating-Point is the first machines that everyone should do and should complete. You don't have to pay for VIP, however it does limit how many machines it allows you to have.  

To find a specific machine, you will need to know at least the difficulty of said machine. Go to that folder and find that machines folder. This is will include a markdown version like this README, but there will also a pdf version that is a bit more professional style.
