# Welcome!  
This document is designed to help those that want to get started with Hacking. This is a live document is will be updated where neccessary.  

## Pick A Virtual Machine Software  
You have 3 choices.  

For Windows and Mac users, you have VMware Pro and VirtualBox. These two are strong and recommended choices by most people, I recommend VMware Pro if you are using Windows or Mac.  
For Linux Users, You can install VirtualBox via your distros package handler, but I would recommend QEMU instead. It's lightweight, which means it's not costing your machine a ton resources to run. Perfect for isolated VM machine specifics.  

## Installing Kali Linux  
Kali Linux will be your new home. Get comfortable with it, as it is recommended by so many when it comes to learning hacking. This has pretty much most, if not all, the tools you would need to get started, all built in to the distro.  

## What should I do ?  
With Kali installed on your machine, what should you do in order to start learning? I highly recommend that a HackTheBox (HTB) account is created. HTB is an amazing platform for you to learn and practice hacking. All of their courses are very details and give hands on practice based on the lesson you are doing. You can take the basic from their Academy and go into the Labs and practice your skills even more. Another account you could create is a TryHackMe account. They are very similar to HTB, they offer education and competitive Labs with new challenges to practice your skills.
